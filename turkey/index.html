See "History and Tradition" below to learn about these crazy traditions. Average to brisk pace to the mountain. After loading up with rocks at the old gate (bathrooms) there's an unofficial race to Dobbins. Please come self contained as there is no support. About 40 miles round trip.</td></tr>

It is an unsponsored, unsanctioned event and just happens every year. Everyone is welcome. Those without helmets will asked to ride by themselves. The pace is casual to spirited to the base of the mountain. Some will participate in the unofficial contest to Dobbins, some will ride up at their own pace there and others will be anti-social and skip Dobbins to ride to the Towers. It's all good!</td></tr>

			<b>History</b><br />
			<p>The TurkeyDayRide officially started in 1980. There were 5 riders and the ride started at 5:00am on Thanksgiving morning. The idea was to get a good ride in, get to Dobbins point early enough to watch the sunrise and get home in time to work on Thanksgiving day activities of cleaning and cooking food for the family.</p>
			<p>To the best of my knowledge the five riders were Joel Nelson, Scott Foster, Greg Sumrall, John Brush and Jim Norman. They will correct me if I am wrong except John Brush who is no longer with us. Peace out John! </p>
			There were two years where the ride did not take place and one due to Covid which is why it seems we are three years off.
